# microPowerLab
PowerShellDSC Scripts to setup a small lab environment for testing puposes.
The scripts set the ip information, time zone, and rename the machine while adding it to the domain, with the exception of the DC since there is no Domain yet. Next they install their application. Once they are finished you are good to go with testing.

First create the Domain Controller<br>
Next create the SQL server<br>
Finally create the first SharePoint server in the farm and add more SharePoint server to the farm if you want.<br>

You will need the following PowerShell DSC Modules:<br>

ActiveDirectoryDsc<br> https://github.com/dsccommunity/ActiveDirectoryDsc<br>
ComputerManagementDsc<br> https://github.com/dsccommunity/ComputerManagementDsc<br>
NetworkingDsc<br> https://github.com/dsccommunity/NetworkingDsc<br>
SharePointDsc<br> https://github.com/dsccommunity/SharePointDsc<br>
SqlServerDsc<br> https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc<br>
xDnsServer<br> https://github.com/dsccommunity/xDnsServer<br>

You will need a virtual machine image that is just Windows OS with the latest patches/updates for each role.<br>

You will need to the extracted ISO files for SQL and SharePoint in a share on the Domain Controller. Yes I know you are not supposed to use your Domain Controller as a file share but this project is for setting a very small lab for testing only.<br>

You will also need all the prerequisites for SharePoint in a share on the Domain Controller as well.

You will need to copy the above PowerShell DSC modules in the C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules before you run the scripts.

Yes you will need to run Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted before you run the scripts.

If you have questions please ask or open an issue.
